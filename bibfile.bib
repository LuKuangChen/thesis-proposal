  abstract = {Knowledge about students' programming errors is a valuable source to get insights into students deficiencies and misconceptions. In this paper, we use data from an introductory C programming course to identify which errors are often made by students. Previous studies often focused only on syntactic and semantic errors as they can be easily identified by compilers. Studies focusing on logic errors were often restricted to a limited set of concepts or performed for a small set of data. We manually inspect 12371 submission by 280 students and have no restrictions regarding the error types we are looking for. We classify our found errors into six categories: syntactic, conceptual, strategic, sloppiness, misinterpretation, and domain knowledge. Our results show that a big portion of errors made by students is simply caused by sloppiness. But putting sloppiness aside, students seem to have most problems with strategic knowledge, i.e., the problem solving ability. We compare our results to previous studies and provide some implications of our results for future teaching practice.},

Estimates of difficulty can be derived empirically, usually by piloting items, or theoretically from models. Empirical results, in turn, can inform theory and refine models. In this article, we compare four methods of estimating the item difficulty for a typical topic of introductory programming courses: control flow. For a given set of items that have been tested empirically, we also collected expert ratings and additionally applied measures of code complexity both from software engineering and from computer science education research The results show that there is some overlap between empirical results and theoretical predictions. However, for the simple item format that we have been using, the models all fall short in offering enough explanatory power regarding the observed variance in difficulty. Empirical difficulty in turn can serve as the basis for rules that can be used for item generation in the future.},

The erratic behavior of the coverage probability of the standard Wald confidence interval has previously been remarked on in the literature (Blyth and Still, Agresti and Coull, Santner and others). We begin by showing that the chaotic coverage properties of the Wald interval are far more persistent than is appreciated. Furthermore, common textbook prescriptions regarding its safety are misleading and defective in several respects and cannot be trusted. This leads us to consideration of alternative intervals. A number of natural alternatives are presented, each with its motivation and context. Each interval is examined for its coverage probability and its length. Based on this analysis, we recommend the Wilson interval or the equal-tailed Jeffreys prior interval for small n and the interval suggested in Agresti and Coull for larger n. We also provide an additional frequentist justification for use of the Jeffreys interval.},

The identification, documentation, and validation of misconceptions is a long and time-consuming work, usually carried out using iterative cycles of students answering open-ended questionnaires, interviews with instructors and students, exam analysis, and discussion with experts. A comprehensive list of validated misconceptions in some subject can be used to build formal evaluation methods like the Concept Inventory (CI), a multiple-choice questionnaire that is usually performed as pre-post tests in order to assess any change in student understanding. In CS1, validated misconceptions were identified and documented in C and Python programming languages. Although there are studies related to misconceptions in the Java language, these misconceptions lack the formality, comprehensiveness, and robustness of their C and Python counterparts. On this work, we propose a methodology to adapt the validated misconceptions in C and Python to Java. Initially, through the analysis of an initial list of 33 misconceptions in C and 28 in Python, we identified and documented in an antipattern format 31 possible misconceptions in Java. We then developed a final term exam, composed of 7 open-ended questions, in which each question was designed to address some of the misconceptions covered in the course (N=27). Through the analysis of the exams answers (N = 69 students), it was possible to validate 22 of the misconceptions (81\%). Also, 6 new misconceptions were identified, leading to a total of 28 valid misconceptions in Java.},

Since novices lack domain-specific knowledge, many instructional techniques attempt to provide them with a framework or mental model that can be used for incorporating new information. A major research question concerns how to encourage the acquisition of good mental models and how these models influence the learning process. One possible technique for providing an effective mental model is to use dynamic cues that make transparent to the user all the changes in the variable values, source codes, output, etc., as the program runs. Two groups of novice programmers were used in the experiment. All subjects learned some programming notions in the C language (MIXC). The MIXC version of the programming language provides a debugging facility (C trace) designed to show through a system window all the program components. Subjects were either allowed to use this facility or not allowed to do so. Performance measures of programming and debugging were taken as well as measures directed to assess subjects' mental models. Results showed differences in the way in which the two groups represented and organized programming concepts, although the performance tasks did not show parallel effects.},

Although necessary to construct linked data structures and networks of interacting objects, aliasing is problematic in that an aggregate object's state can change via an alias to one of its components, without the aggregate being aware of any aliasing.Ownership types form a static type system that indicates object ownership. This provides a flexible mechanism to limit the visibility of object references and restrict access paths to objects, thus controlling a system's dynamic topology. The type system is shown to be sound, and the specific aliasing properties that a system's object graph satisfies are formulated and proven invariant for well-typed programs.},

  abstract = {Background and Context. Modern programming is replete with features like closures, callbacks, generators, asynchronous functions, and so on. These features can be subtle in their behavior and interaction with the rest of the language, so students need notional machines that are both accurate and manageable. We specifically focus on stacks and their associated environments, which are key to understanding these features. Objectives. What conceptions do students have of stacks and environments on entry to a tertiary, upper-level programming languages course? What impact does coursework around an interpreter-based approach to programming languages education have on their understanding? What is the value of the tooling we create for students to express notional machine states? Method. Our studies were conducted at two different institutions in a tertiary, upper-level course on programming languages. The intermediate interventions were different, but both used a pre-/post-test format conducted at the beginning and near the end of the semester. We also created a Snap!-based tool to assist in notional machine description. Findings. We found that students have a relatively weak understanding of stacks and environments at entry, and exhibited various misconceptions. At one institution, which primarily relied on interpreters, we found numerous problems persisted at the end of the semester. At the other, which in addition to interpreters also used direct instruction and the Snap!-based tool, students did much better\textemdash but still not on aspects that we would have liked to have transferred from interpreters. Implications. Our findings suggest that it is important for other educators to also assess their students' understanding of stacks and environments, especially in light of modern programming concepts. Assuming similar misconceptions are widespread, we believe the community needs to invest much more effort into notional machines, so that students can better understand the features and programs they are working with. In particular, the ``standard'' stack presentation is insufficient and in some cases even ``harmful'' (since it reinforces some misconceptions), and hence must be revised. Finally, our study forces a reconsideration of the learning objectives met by interpreters in programming languages education.},

This paper describes our attempt to systematically design a pedagogy for ownership types. First, we studied Rust developers' misconceptions of ownership to create the Ownership Inventory, a new instrument for measuring a person's knowledge of ownership. We found that Rust learners could not connect Rust's static and dynamic semantics, such as determining why an ill-typed program would (or would not) exhibit undefined behavior. Second, we created a conceptual model of Rust's semantics that explains borrow checking in terms of flow-sensitive permissions on paths into memory. Third, we implemented a Rust compiler plugin that visualizes programs under the model. Fourth, we integrated the permissions model and visualizations into a broader pedagogy of ownership by writing a new ownership chapter for The Rust Programming Language, a popular Rust textbook. Fifth, we evaluated an initial deployment of our pedagogy against the original version, using reader responses to the Ownership Inventory as a point of comparison. Thus far, the new pedagogy has improved learner scores on the Ownership Inventory by an average of 9},

  abstract = {The term "the machine" is commonly used to refer to the complicated physical hardware running similarly complex software that ultimately executes programs. The idea that programmers write programs for a notional machine - an abstract model of an execution environment - not the machine itself, has risen to the point of gaining acceptance as a useful device in computing education. This has seeded a growing discussion about how explicitly utilizing notional machines in teaching can help students construct more accurate mental models, which is essential for learning programming. Much of the existing literature necessarily involves specific languages, visualization, and/or facilitating tools, and is not very accessible to many practitioners. Less focus has been put on how teachers can make explicit use of notional machines in their teaching. In this paper we describe notional machines and their use in a manner that is more accessible to a general educator audience in order to facilitate more effective computing education at all levels. We advocate explicitly delineating between visualization tools and the notional machines they depict, isolating and clarifying the notional machine so that it is conspicuous, apparent and useful. We present examples of how this approach can facilitate a more consistent method of teaching computing, and be used in more effective pedagogical practice for teaching computing.},

A key point we learned while creating this notional machine is that many of the difficulties encountered were due to the concept of a notional machine being tightly coupled to students' mental models. Although not surprising, the numerous complications this brings are important to overcome. The potential amount of detail included in the notional machine is enormously influenced by the students' mental models, which are likely specific to a course, and also change throughout a semester \textendash{} and certainly across several semesters. We present lessons learned from this experience, among them that implementing a notional machine and using it in class is a non-trivial yet possibly beneficial exercise.},

During the first stage, called received knowledge or dualism, people expect knowledge to be handed to them by authority figures (thus ``received'') and think in terms of black and white (thus ``dualism''). Our experience indicates that many computer science students are at this first stage of learning. To help students move beyond this stage, we describe a system and strategy, the PL-Detective, to be used in a Concepts of Programming Languages course. Assignments using this system directly confront students with the notion that they can create knowledge via interactions with the PL-Detective and that discussion with students (rather than asking the instructor) is an effective way of learning how to reason. We present experimental results that show that the PL-Detective is effective in helping students move beyond the stage of received knowledge.},

The theory has evolved over a number of decades, addressing shortcomings in earlier versions; other issues remain and are being debated by the CLT community. We conduct a systematic mapping review of how CLT has been used across a number of leading computing education research (CER) forums since 2010. We find that the most common reason to cite CLT is to mention it briefly as a design influence; authors predominantly cite old versions of the theory; hypotheses phrased in terms of cognitive load components are rare; and only a small selection of cognitive load measures have been applied, sparsely. Overall, the theory's evolution and recent themes in CLT appear to have had limited impact on CER so far. We recommend that studies in CER explain which version of the theory they use and why; clearly distinguish between load components (e.g., intrinsic and extraneous load); phrase hypotheses in terms of load components a priori; look further into validating different measures of cognitive load; accompany cognitive load measures with complementary constructs, such as motivation; and explore themes such as collaborative CLT and individual differences in working-memory capacity.},

In this framework, detailed learning objectives are written down as rules of program behavior (RPBs).

Different programming languages, student cohorts, and contexts call for different RPBs. Instructional designers may define progressions of RPB rulesets for different stages of a programming course or curriculum; we identify evaluation criteria for RPBs and discuss tradeoffs in RPB design. As a proof-of-concept example, we present a progression of rulesets designed for teaching beginners how expressions, variables, and functions work in Python. We submit that the RPB framework is valuable to practitioners and researchers as a tool for design and communication. Within computing education research, the framework can inform, among other things, the ongoing exploration of ``notional machines'' and the design of assessments and visualizations. The theoretical work that we report here lays a foundation for future empirical research that compares the effectiveness of RPB rulesets as well as different methods for teaching a particular ruleset.},

Does more programming experience iron out these misconceptions naturally, or are interventions required? This paper explores students' understanding of these topics in the context of a programming languages class for third- and fourth-year CS majors. Our pre- and post-tests pose questions in two programming languages to gauge whether upper-level students transfer knowledge between languages. Many students held misconceptions about these concepts at the start of the course. Students made progress in only some languages and topics, and cross-language transfer does not occur naturally. We also discuss various pedagogic activities we used to engage students with these concepts, and provide data and student opinion on their effectiveness.},

Our study design has two novelties: the problems require students to deal with data-processing challenges (such as noisy data), and the questions ask students to not only produce but also evaluate programs. We present preliminary results from using our study in multiple courses from different linguistic paradigms. We discuss several future studies that are prompted by these results.},

Few of these have explored students from CS1 courses that use functional programming. The concepts and programming styles commonly taught in such courses give CS1 students more viable plan-composition options than in traditional imperative CS1 courses. Using data from five functional-language CS1 courses at four schools, we show that our students choose different high-level structures and make fewer low-level errors compared to results of other Rainfall studies. We discuss the potential role of language in these results and raise various questions that could further explore these effects.},

This study examined student knowledge relating to parameter passing in Pascal. During interviews, students were asked to predict which programs from a collection of similar programs would work according to specification and which would not work due to variable access errors or parameter passing errors. This paper will discuss these interviews. In particular it will examine the most pervasive false assumptions or ``student-constructed rules'' exposed by the interviews. It will also discuss hints provided by the interviews regarding instructional methods to emphasize and instructional methods to avoid.},

We argue that the most successful forms of Bayesian statistics do not actually support that particular philosophy but rather accord much better with sophisticated forms of hypothetico-deductivism. We examine the actual role played by prior distributions in Bayesian models, and the crucial aspects of model checking and model revision, which fall outside the scope of Bayesian confirmation theory. We draw on the literature on the consistency of Bayesian updating and also on our experience of applied work in social science. Clarity about these matters should benefit not just philosophy of science, but also statistical practice. At best, the inductivist view has encouraged researchers to fit and compare models without checking them; at worst, theorists have actively discouraged practitioners from performing model checking because it does not fit into their framework.},

AutoTutor presents challenging problems (formulated as questions) from a curriculum script and then engages in mixed initiative dialogue that guides the student in building an answer. It provides the student with positive, neutral, or negative feedback on the student's typed responses, pumps the student for more information, prompts the student to fill in missing words, gives hints, fills in missing information with assertions, identifies and corrects erroneous ideas, answers the student's questions, and summarizes answers.

Well-constructed analogical comparisons focus attention on the causal-relational structure of STEM concepts, and provide a powerful capability to draw inferences based on a well-understood source domain that can be applied to a novel target domain. However, analogy must be applied with consideration to students' prior knowledge and cognitive resources. We briefly review theoretical and empirical support for incorporating analogy into education, and recommend five general principles to guide its application so as to maximize the potential benefits. For analogies to be effective, instructors should use well-understood source analogs and explain correspondences fully; use visuospatial and verbal supports to emphasize shared structure among analogs; discuss the alignment between semantic and formal representations; reduce extraneous cognitive load imposed by analogical comparison; and encourage generation of inferences when students have some proficiency with the material. These principles can be applied flexibly to topics in a wide variety of domains.},

Past research conducted in the context of text-based programming points to several challenges related to novice learners' understanding of foundational programming constructs such as variables, loops, and expressions. This research aims to develop assessment items for measuring student understanding in introductory CS classrooms in middle school using a principled approach for assessment design. This paper describes the design of assessments items that were piloted with 100 6th, 7th, 8th graders who had completed an introductory programming course using Scratch. The results and follow-up cognitive thinkalouds indicate that students are generally unfamiliar with the use of variables, and harbor misconceptions about them. They also have trouble with other aspects of introductory programming such as how loops work, and how the Boolean operators work. These findings point to the need for pedagogy that combines popular constructionist activities with those that target conceptual learning, along with better professional development to support teachers' conceptual learning of these foundational constructs.},

Therefore, this paper aims to study students' proficiency with these core concepts, and students' ability to apply procedural and data abstraction to solve problems. We collected data from two years of an introductory Python course, both from a questionnaire and from two lab assignments. The data shows that students had difficulties with the core concepts, and a number of issues solving problems with abstraction. We also investigate the impact of using a visualization tool when teaching the core concepts.},

For example, some novices think that a variable can hold multiple values, in the case of two consecutive assignment statements, such as x = 5; x = 7. While explaining variables introductory materials often use the metaphor of a box for a variable, which might contribute to the 'multiple values' hypothesis. To investigate this, we design and run a controlled experiment with 496 novice programmers, both children and adults. Half of our participants receive an introductory programming lesson in which we explain a variable as a box, while the other half of participants receive the explanation of a variable as being a label. They are subsequently questioned about their understanding of variables. Our results show that, for the simple questions involving one assignment, the box group performs better. However, for questions involving the misconception \textemdash{} with two consecutive assignment statements \textemdash{} the label group outperforms the box group. This however primarily occurs when considering variables of type string, for integers subjects interpret the statements as numeric values to be added.},

The multi-armed bandit problem arises in sequentially allocating effort to one of N projects and sequentially assigning patients to one of N treatments in clinical trials. Gittins and Jones (Gittins, J. C., Jones, D. M. 1974. A dynamic allocation index for the sequential design of experiments. J. Gani, K. Sarkadi, L. Vince, eds. Progress in Statistics. European Meeting of Statisticians, 1972, 1, North Holland, Amsterdam, 241\textendash 266.) have shown that one optimal policy for the N-project problem, an N-dimensional discounted Markov decision chain, is determined by the following largest-index rule. There is an index for each state of each given project that depends only on the data of that project. In each period one allocates effort to a project with largest current index. The purpose of this paper is to give a short proof of this result and a new characterization of the index of a project in state i, viz., as the maximum expected present value in state i for the restart-in-i problem in which, in each state and period, one either continues allocating effort to the project or immediately restarts the project in state i. Moreover, it is shown that an approximate largest-index rule yields an approximately optimal policy. These results lead to more efficient methods of computing the indices on-line and/or for sparse transition matrices in large state spaces than have been suggested heretofore. By using a suitable implementation of successive approximations, a policy whose expected present value is within 100{$\epsilon\%$} of the maximum possible range of values of the indices can be found on-line with at most (N + T - 1)TM operations where M is the number of operations required to calculate one approximation, T is the least integer majorizing the ratio ln {$\epsilon$}/ln a and 0 {$<$} a {$<$} 1 is the discount factor.},

We conducted a pencil-and-paper survey consisting of a demographic questionnaire and 21 content-based questions with 106 students at the start of a second semester course for CS majors (i.e., CS2) at a large public U.S. university with a focus on engineering and science. We then selected the questions that appeared to be most problematic for students and several closely related questions and analyzed the student reasoning for each question and across questions with similar concepts. We found that students exhibited misconceptions related to pass by value versus pass by reference semantics, "false sharing" of variables of the same name in different scopes, and believing that global variables may not be accessed from the main function and/or that a global variable may be modified via a local variable of the same name (i.e., in the presence of variable shadowing). Potential explanations for these misconceptions include fragile knowledge, lack of attention to detail, over-attention to newly acquired knowledge, information foraging (abductive reasoning) in the presence of misleading contextual clues, and lack of exposure to the use of global variables beyond the specification of constants.},

We have designed a labelling to classify the tools, and use Narciss' feedback content categories to classify feedback messages. We report on the results of coding a total of 101 tools. We have found that feedback mostly focuses on identifying mistakes and less on fixing problems and taking a next step. Furthermore, teachers cannot easily adapt tools to their own needs.

This paper describes a tutoring system that lets students practice with improving small programs that are already functionally correct. The system is based on rules that are extracted from input by teachers collected in a preliminary study, a subset of rules taken from professional tools, and other literature. Rules define how a code construct can be rewritten into a better variant, without changing its functionality. Rules can be combined to form rewrite strategies, similar to refactorings offered by most IDEs. The student can ask for hints and feedback at each step. We describe the design of the system, show example sessions, and evaluate and discuss its contribution and limitations.},

The common increment pattern x = x + 1 is even believed to be outright impossible. This paper discusses a multi-year project examining how high school students think of assignments and variables. In particular, where does the misconception of storing entire calculations come from? Can we explain the students' thinking and help them develop correct models of how programming works? It is particularly striking that a model of the computer as a machine with algebraic capabilities would indeed produce the observed misconceptions. The misconception might simply be attributed to the expectation that the computer performs computations the exact same way students are taught to in mathematics.},

It is hence typical for the educators to try to constantly improve their teaching methods to enhance the quality and outcome of the courses. We have developed an educational tool called ViLLE, which allows us to create interactive and automatically assessed programming exercises easily. In these exercises, the students have a near-to-authentic programming environment with compiler output and error messages provided. The same tool was used in our university's introductory programming course's final exam. In this paper, we analyze students' answers to three different coding exercises in this final exam. Since ViLLE automatically stores the program code when compiled, we have an access to previously unseen amounts of iterations of the exercise instead of just the final submission. The data is analyzed to identify typical misconceptions in programming exercises, and to show how the students gradually improve their answers based on the results and error messages. Finally, we discuss how the results of the analysis can be utilized to tackle these misconceptions during the course.},

  abstract = {A study by a ITiCSE 2001 working group ("the McCracken Group") established that many students do not know how to program at the conclusion of their introductory courses. A popular explanation for this incapacity is that the students lack the ability to problem-solve. That is, they lack the ability to take a problem description, decompose it into sub-problems and implement them, then assemble the pieces into a complete solution. An alternative explanation is that many students have a fragile grasp of both basic programming principles and the ability to systematically carry out routine programming tasks, such as tracing (or "desk checking") through code. This ITiCSE 2004 working group studied the alternative explanation, by testing students from seven countries, in two ways. First, students were tested on their ability to predict the outcome of executing a short piece of code. Second, students were tested on their ability, when given the desired function of short piece of near-complete code, to select the correct completion of the code from a small set of possibilities. Many students were weak at these tasks, especially the latter task, suggesting that such students have a fragile grasp of skills that are a prerequisite for problem-solving.},

The performance of students on code tracing tasks correlated with their performance on code writing tasks. A correlation was also found between performance on "explain in plain English" tasks and code writing. A stepwise regression, with performance on code writing as the dependent variable, was used to construct a path diagram. The diagram suggests the possibility of a hierarchy of programming related tasks. Knowledge of programming constructs forms the bottom of the hierarchy, with "explain in English", Parson's puzzles, and the tracing of iterative code forming one or more intermediate levels in the hierarchy.},

The qualitative findings identify the range of mental models of value and reference assignment held by the participants. The quantitative analysis reveals that approximately one third of students held non-viable mental models of value assignment and only 17\% of students held a viable mental model of reference assignment. Further, in terms of a comparison between the participants' mental models and their performance in in-course assessments and final examination, it was found that students with viable mental models performed significantly better than those with non-viable models. These findings are used to propose a more "constructivist" approach to teaching programming based on the integration of "cognitive conflict" and program visualisation.},

The underlying goal of this work was to initiate dialog in the Computer Science community on how to develop these types of assessments. Several universities participated in our trial assessment and the disappointing results suggest that many students do not know how to program at the conclusion of their introductory courses. For a combined sample of 216 students from four universities, the average score was 22.89 out of 110 points on the general evaluation criteria developed for this study.

Although instructing students to compare pairs of problems may help call attention to the appropriate features of the domain, the literature is mixed regarding the types of comparisons that are most beneficial, analogical comparisons or contrasting comparisons. Experiments on learning exploratory data analysis suggest a possible reconciliation of the competing claims, by distinguishing between the learning gains produced by each comparison type. By precisely assessing students' knowledge before and after the comparisons, these studies reveal that analogical comparisons promote generalization across surface features, while contrasting comparisons promote discrimination between structures. Results indicate that these skills vary across individuals and should be assessed separately to optimally match instruction to their needs.}

Most studies about misconceptions in programming are conducted at the undergraduate level, yet there is a lack of studies at the elementary school (K-12) level, reasonably because computer science neither programming are regularly still not the part of elementary school curricula's. Are the misconceptions about loops at elementary school level equal to those at the undergraduate level? Can we ``prevent'' the misconceptions by using the different pedagogical approach, visual programming language and shifting the programming context toward game programming? In this paper, we tried to answer these questions. We conducted the student misconceptions research on one of the fundamental programming concepts \textendash{} the loop. The research is conducted in the classroom settings among 207 elementary school students. Students were learning to program in three programming languages: Scratch, Logo and Python.

  abstract = {Computing learners may not master basic concepts, or forget them between courses or from infrequent use. Learners also often struggle with advanced computing courses, perhaps from weakness with prerequisite concepts. One underlying challenge for researchers and instructors is determining the reason why a learner gets an advanced question wrong. Was the wrong answer because the learner lacked prerequisite skills, has not mastered the advanced skill, or some combination of the two? We contribute a design investigation into how to create differentiated questions which diagnose prerequisite and advanced skills at the same time. We focused on tracing and related skills as prerequisites, and on advanced object-oriented programming, concurrency, algorithm and data structures as the advanced skills. We conducted an inductive qualitative analysis of existing assessment questions from instructors and from a concept inventory with a validity argument (the Basic Data Structures Inventory). We found dependencies on a variety of prerequisite knowledge and mixed potential for diagnosing difficulties with prerequisites. Inspired by this analysis, we developed examples of differentiated assessments and reflected on design principles for creating/modifying assessments to better assess both advanced and prerequisite skills. Our example differentiated assessment questions and methods help enable research into how prerequisites skills affect learning of advanced concepts. They also may help instructors better understand and help learners with varying prerequisite knowledge, which may improve equity of learning outcomes. Our work also raises theoretical questions about what assessments really assess and how separate advanced topics and prerequisite skills are.},

  abstract = {A programming system is the user interface between the programmer and the computer. Programming is a notoriously difficult activity, and some of this difficulty can be attributed to the user interface as opposed to other factors. Historically, the designs of programming languages and tools have not emphasized usability. This thesis describes a new process for designing programming systems where HCI knowledge, principles and methods play an important role in all design decisions. The process began with an exhaustive review of three decades of research and observations about the difficulties encountered by beginner programmers. This material was catalogued and organized for this project as well as for the benefit of other future language designers. Where questions remained unanswered, new studies were designed and conducted, to examine how beginners naturally think about and express problem solutions. These studies revealed ways that current popular programming languages fail to support the natural abilities of beginners. All of this information was then used to design HANDS, a new programming system for children. HANDS is an event-based system featuring a concrete model for computation based on concepts that are familiar to non-programmers. HANDS provides queries and aggregate operations to match the way non-programmers express problem solutions, and includes domain-specific features to facilitate the creation of interactive animations and simulations. In user tests, children using the HANDS system performed significantly better than children using a version of the system that lacked several of these features. This is evidence that the process described here had a positive impact on the design of HANDS, and could have a similar impact on other new programming language designs. The contributions of this thesis include a survey of the knowledge about beginner programmers that is organized for programming system designers, empirical evidence about how non-programmers express problem solutions, the HANDS programming system for children, a new model of computation that is concrete and based on familiar concepts, an evaluation of the effectiveness of key features of HANDS, and a case study of a new user-centered design process for creating programming systems.},

Over the past two decades, many aspects of novice programming have been investigated, resulting in the discovery of important facts and tradeoffs about what makes programming difficult to learn, and about the effectiveness of existing languages, environments, and methods of instruction. However, because this research is dispersed throughout the literature, it is difficult for designers of new programming systems to consider all of the issues collectively. The result is that most new systems are built primarily around technical objectives, perhaps considering only a subset of the usability issues summarized here. In addition to providing a checklist of issues that should be considered in the design of future systems, this report can be used to help researchers identify fruitful topics of future novice programming research.},

We show how the available evidence, and the underlying assumptions about the process of learning to program, fail to address this issue adequately. Our analysis is based on a developmental cognitive science perspective on learning to program, incorporating developmental and cognitive science considerations of the mental activities involved in programming. It highlights the importance for future research of investigating students' interactions with instructional and programming contexts, developmental transformations of their programming skills, and their background knowledge and reasoning abilities.},

Three different classes of bugs?parallelism, intentionality, and egocentrism?are identified, and exemplified through student errors. It is suggested that these classes of conceptual bugs are rooted in a ?superbug,? the default strategy that there is a hidden mind somewhere in the programming language that has intelligent interpretive powers.},

In order to help both students and teachers, we developed an overview of misconceptions around variables, a test to help identify these misconceptions, and an interactive video intervention to help transform them into the correct way of thinking about variables.

This study reviews several of the most commonly used inductive teaching methods, including inquiry learning, problem-based learning, project-based learning, case-based teaching, discovery learning, and just-in-time teaching. The paper defines each method, highlights commonalities and specific differences, and reviews research on the effectiveness of the methods. While the strength of the evidence varies from one method to another, inductive methods are consistently found to be at least equal to, and in general more effective than, traditional deductive methods for achieving a broad range of learning outcomes.},

Identifying and addressing students' misconceptions is a key part of a computer science teacher's competence. However, relevant research on this topic is not as fully developed in the computer science education field as it is in mathematics and science education. In this article, we first review relevant literature on general definitions of misconceptions and studies about students' misconceptions and other difficulties in introductory programming. Next, we investigate the factors that contribute to the difficulties. Finally, strategies and tools to address difficulties including misconceptions are discussed. Based on the review of literature, we found that students exhibit various misconceptions and other difficulties in syntactic knowledge, conceptual knowledge, and strategic knowledge. These difficulties experienced by students are related to many factors including unfamiliarity of syntax, natural language, math knowledge, inaccurate mental models, lack of strategies, programming environments, and teachers' knowledge and instruction. However, many sources of students' difficulties have connections with students' prior knowledge. To better understand and address students' misconceptions and other difficulties, various instructional approaches and tools have been developed. Nevertheless, the dissemination of these approaches and tools has been limited. Thus, first, we suggest enhancing the dissemination of existing tools and approaches and investigating their long-term effects. Second, we recommend that computing education research move beyond documenting misconceptions to address the development of students' (mis)conceptions by integrating conceptual change theories. Third, we believe that developing and enhancing instructors' pedagogical content knowledge (PCK), including their knowledge of students' misconceptions and ability to apply effective instructional approaches and tools to address students' difficulties, is vital to the success of teaching introductory programming.},

Our results indicated that teachers? confidence of addressing misconceptions and the teaching context may affect their perceptions of student misconceptions.

Many of these educators have degrees in disciplines other than computer science, such as math, science, and business, so preparing them to teach CS is a challenge, particularly since most K-12 teachers have limited time to devote to learning new curriculum. This study describes how we managed a short course in computational thinking and programming to a group of high school teachers. We illustrate through survey data assessment and evaluation that significant gains in skill level and self-efficacy can be realized within a short but intensive week of face-to-face training. Five months later we follow-up with the same cohort to see if earlier achievements remain evident over time. Discussion throughout the paper identifies strengths and weaknesses of the training week, which is useful to others planning to undertake similar PD offerings.},

Various problems experienced by novices are identified, including issues relating to basic program design, to algorithmic complexity in certain language features, to the ``fragility'' of novice knowledge, and so on. We summarise this material and suggest some practical implications for teachers. We suggest that a key issue that emerges is the distinction between effective and ineffective novices. What characterises effective novices? Is it possible to identify the specific deficits of ineffective novices and help them to become effective learners of programming?}

The results are evaluated using the Structure of Observed Learning Outcomes (SOLO) taxonomy. The participants were divided into an experimental group and a control group. The students from the control group learned programming in the traditional case-based teaching method. The students in the experimental group learned programming by applying the role-based approach to the case-based teaching method. For the purposes of determining the effects of the role-based teaching, the SOLO taxonomy was used to evaluate the results of the participants? final paper?pencil test. The SOLO level of the code reading and code writing was graded according to the SOLO categories for program comprehension and construction. Data analyses show that (a) there was a higher level of performance and cognitive ability in the experimental group, (b) there were some positive and significant correlations between student?s final examination scores and their SOLO level of the code reading and code writing, and (c) the SOLO level of the code writing and code reading was significantly related. These results suggest that the role of variable is effective on improving novice programming.},

  abstract = {Modern web technologies have enabled new ways of producing interactive learning content. This content can be embedded into course materials on the web. Still the process to produce and distribute online activities is challenging for instructors. In this thesis, we introduce three new systems to support the process of producing learning content, distributing it, and letting instructors customize the content to their particular teaching goals and contexts. More specifically, we explore the topic in the domain of computer science education. We use program animations as a central theme. In addition to describing the technical aspects, we report preliminary results from CS1 courses which have used these systems to provide interactive content for learners. The first part of the thesis presents the Jsvee library for creating program animations which gives a visual representation of a notional machine and shows how the program state changes when a program is executed step-by-step. Animations are aimed at novice programmers who are learning the execution model. The library supports expression-level visualization, and because of its extensibility, it can support programming language specific visualizations. In addition to the technical discussion, we present preliminary results how learners in two different CS1 courses used the animations made with Jsvee. We use automatically collected log files as a primary data source to analyze the usage. Although learners did not receive any points, over 80\% of novices voluntary viewed animations throughout the CS1 course which tightly integrated over 50 animations with other course materials.},

Visual program simulation tries to get students to act on their conceptions; a VPS-supporting software system may be built so that it reacts to student behaviors and provides feedback tailored to address suspected misconceptions. To focus our efforts in developing the feedback given by our VPS system, UUhistle, we wished to identify the most common mistakes that students make and to explore the reasons behind them. We analyzed the mistakes in over 24,000 student-submitted solutions to VPS assignments collected over three years. 26 mistakes stood out as relatively common and therefore worthy of particular attention. Some of the mistakes appear to be related to usability issues and others to known misconceptions about programming concepts; others still suggest previously unreported conceptual difficulties. Beyond helping us develop our visualization tool, our study lends tentative support to the claim that many VPS mistakes are linked to programming misconceptions and VPS logs can be a useful data source for studying students' understandings of CS1 content.},

We tested this prediction by developing a computer-based module whereby participants learned about emergent processes.

The results show that learners create various kinds of mental models of programming concepts, and that the concept of variable, which is fundamental to most types of programming, is understood in various non-viable ways.

From an analysis of interviews with learners and supplementary observational data, six different ways of perceiving learning through VPS emerged. While a rich understanding of VPS opens up rich possibilities for learning programming, we also uncovered several ways of understanding VPS that do not afford such opportunities. For instance, learners do not always attribute meaning to the visual elements, and even when they do, they may fail to associate the visualised concepts with programming practice. Our results concretise how learners have to experience a number of key insights about VPS before effective learning through VPS can take place. Based on our findings, we make pedagogical recommendations with the overall goal of improving the integration of VPS and the rest of the teaching and learning environment. Our results may find applications beyond VPS within educational program visualisation in general.},

  abstract = {This thesis formulates and evaluates a pedagogical technique whose goal is to help beginners learn the basics of computer programming. The technique, visual program simulation (VPS), involves the learner in interactive simulations in which the learner takes on the role of the computer as the executor of a program. The student uses a given visualization of a so-called notional machine, an abstract computer, to illustrate what happens in memory as the computer processes the program. The purpose of these simulations is to help the beginner learn to reason about program execution, a skill whose development has been identified as a major challenge in introductory programming education. VPS promotes effective learning by seeking to cognitively engage the learner with a visualization. It can be made practical through visualization software. VPS software may also automatically assess students' simulations and provide personal feedback, which is a valuable asset especially in the large classes that are typical of introductory courses. The thesis contributes to VPS in four ways. First, it formulates the concept of visual program simulation and outlines its underpinnings in terms of learning theory. Second, it presents a new software prototype that facilitates the use of VPS in practice. Third, it reports on a preliminary empirical evaluation of VPS and the software in the context of an introductory programming course. Fourth, it makes recommendations on the use of VPS in teaching and the further development of VPS tools, which arise from the empirical work. The findings from a mixed-methods evaluation of VPS suggest that it is a promising pedagogical approach that helps many students learn programming. At the same time, the evaluation highlights certain important weaknesses. The purpose of VPS is not obvious to many students. Care must be taken to ensure that students develop a rich understanding of what VPS is and what they stand to gain from it. For best results, it is recommended that VPS be tightly integrated into the teaching and learning environment. The results from a controlled experiment further indicate that the short-term learning benefits of a VPS assignment are heavily dependent on which interactions the assignment demands from students. This implies that extreme care must be taken in the design of VPS systems and specific assignments so that required user interactions are aligned with intended learning goals. On a more general level, the thesis serves as an example of educational tool development that is grounded in learning theory and informed by empirical evaluations. A fairly broad review of the literature on learning and teaching introductory programming is also contributed.},

  abstract = {The research presented in this thesis aims at the development of a programming environment for primary schools that is focused on supporting students' autonomous learning and independent troubleshooting. With the introduction of computer science as a new school subject, programming in primary school is currently experiencing a strong and promising rise in popularity. This creative form of learning can foster problem solving skills but it simultaneously requires a high level of precision. Making errors is inevitable and bugs show up in a variety of forms, from simple typos to highly complex misconceptions. Errors pose a significant problem for classroom implementation since students often struggle with troubleshooting and thus depend on external help. Previous research has addressed this problem and presented various approaches that ease primary school programming. Suggestions reach from programming languages with specialized grammars to tangible application domains and block-based programming interfaces. While each of these approaches has its justification in easing the way into programming, still, primary school programmers eventually need to face their errors and acquire appropriate troubleshooting skills. For more than fifty years, educational and professional programming languages have been treated as separate research fields which went through a distinct evolution in terms of error handling. Motivated by the enormous cost of a blunder in industry, numerous tools were developed for professionals to assist them in locating, analyzing, and fixing errors. Sophisticated tools reach from static program analysis all the way to post-mortem debuggers. In contrast, the educational community engaged with primary school programming focused during the last twenty years primarily on preventing errors. Yet, in order to become self-sufficient programmers, novices must be exposed to their own errors at some point. We developed a Logo learning environment with which primary school programmers aged 5 to 12 years can be introduced to programming and which provides novices with age-appropriate error recovery tools, e.g., an advanced syntax checker, static program analysis, type checking and inference, and a reverse debugger. All of these tools have been adapted to the use case in primary schools. We evaluated our approach using a set of more than 2 million structurally-erroneous Logo programs that were collected in over 80 000 user sessions. Using the tools presented in this thesis, 97\% of all structural errors can be detected proactively (i.e., at compile time) and visualized using in-line error markers. In this way, the majority of structural programming errors can be fixed on-the-fly. The remaining 3\% are runtime errors that can be analyzed and examined alongside all logical errors using our debugger. The proposed research has promising implications for primary school programming. Through the direct feedback loop with thousands of users, we gained an insight into their learning including problems and misconceptions. The analysis of structural errors allowed us to target the needs of students more effectively by adapting our teaching materials. In the long run, this improves the quality of programming lessons in primary school and students learn to handle errors on their own.},

One reason for this may be due to the fact that abstractions used in concurrent programs leave more situations undefined compared to sequential programs (e.g., in what order statements are executed), which makes it harder to create a proper mental model of the execution environment. Students who aim to explore the abstractions through testing are further hindered by the non-determinism of concurrent programs since even incorrect programs may seem to work properly most of the time. In this paper we aim to explore how students' understanding these abstractions by examining 137 solutions to two concurrency questions given on the final exam in two years of an introductory concurrency course. To highlight problematic areas of these abstractions, we present alternative abstractions under which each incorrect solution would be correct.},

In this study, we investigate 397 students' ability to predict the outcome of short computer programs. The participants are from different programs and progressions in their studies. We find that students, regardless of program and year, struggle with predicting the outcome of short programs that require an accurate mental model of some less readily apparent concepts, such as references. Further, we discover that there is no significant improvement in the first three years. Finally, we propose further avenues of research to improve these learning outcomes.},

  abstract = {Programming misconceptions have been a topic of interest in introductory programming education, with a focus on university level students. Nowadays, programming is increasingly taught to younger children in schools, sometimes as part of the curriculum. In this study we aim at exploring what misconceptions are held by younger, school-age children. To this end we design a multiple-choice questionnaire with Scratch programming exercises. The questions represent a selected set of 11 known misconceptions and relate to basic programming concepts. 145 participants aged 7 to 17 years, with an experience in programming, took part in the study. Our results show the top three common misconceptions are the difficulty of understanding the sequentiality of statements, that a variable holds one value at a time, and the interactivity of a program when user input is required. Holding a misconception is influenced by the mathematical effect of numbers, semantic meaning of identifiers and high expectations of what a computer can do.Other insights from the results show that older children answer more questions correctly, especially for the variable and control concepts. Children who program in Scratch only seem to have difficulties in answering the questions correctly compared to children who program in Scratch and another language. Our findings suggest that work should focus on identifying Scratch-induced misconceptions, and develop intervention methods to counter those misconceptions as early as possible. Finally, for children who start learning programming with Scratch, materials should be more concept-rich and include diverse exercises for each concept.},

  abstract = {The software industry spends a tremendous amount of effort and resources on software testing and maintenance to improve the quality of software. However, a large portion of the cost may be saved by training high-quality software developers with better Computer Science education. Skilled software developers can not only produce code of fewer bugs and better design but also identify and fix issues more effectively. Therefore, in this thesis, we researched building useful educational tools for facilitating Computer Science education, particularly in introductory programming courses. Since understanding the code execution is the first step of writing high-quality code and software testing, in the first study, we built a web-based interactive tool to teach students necessary comprehension and analysis skills to understand the program execution. Secondly, we built an automated tool for students to interactively practice writing test cases and debugging programs. The tool gauges the test coverage of students' test sets using a large corpus of buggy programs we collected in our previous course sessions. The tool returns the buggy programs as immediate feedback which students' test sets failed to catch. Students need to study those returned buggy programs to gradually improve the testing coverage of their test sets. In the third project, we built a tool that automatically generates high-quality test cases to construct concise test sets for testing students' coding assignment solutions. The tool utilizes heterogeneous historical student incorrect implementations to guide the test case search process. Its generated test cases are expected to provide better test coverage than instructor built tests cases. To validate the effectiveness of our tools, we conducted studies in introductory programming courses among students at Rice and online students of our Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC). The studies showed that, compared with studying traditional Computer Science curriculum, students made significant improvements in understanding basic Computer Science concepts and software testing skills by interacting with our educational tools.},

We could not find research attempting to devise a model that describes the transition process and how students' learning of programming concepts is affected during the shift. In this paper, we propose a model to describe PL transfer for relative novices. In the model, during initial stages of learning a new language, students will engage in learning three categories of concepts, True Carryover Concepts, False Carryover Concepts, or Abstract True Carryover Concepts; during the transition, learners automatically effect a transfer of semantics between languages based on syntax matching. In order to find support for the model, we conducted two empirical studies. Study 1 investigated near-novice undergraduate students transitioning from procedural Python to object-oriented Java while Study 2 investigated near-novice postgraduate students doing a transfer from object-oriented Java to procedural Python. Results for both studies indicate that students had little or no difficulty with transitioning on TCC due to positive semantic transfer based on syntax similarities while they had the most difficulty transitioning on FCC due to negative semantic transfer. Students had little or no semantic transfer on ATCC due to differences in syntax between the languages. We suggest ways in which the model can inform pedagogy on how to ease the transition process.},

  abstract = {There is a large literature from at least as early as 1985 on the difficulties encountered in learning programming languages, and in particular additional programming languages. This thesis concentrates on how students transfer their knowledge from their first programming language to their second. The central idea is to adapt and use theories from linguistics of how people learn second natural languages to illuminate the problems of learning second programming languages. The major claim of this thesis is that: Semantic transfer based on syntax similarities plays a role in relative novices' conceptual transfer between programming languages; the implementation of deliberate semantic transfer interventions during relative novices' second language learning can lead to improved conceptual transfer and understanding in learning a second programming language. This thesis uses mixed methods to investigate how students transition from procedural Python to object-oriented (OO) Java. It includes a sequence of nine research studies building on each other. First, an exploratory qualitative study is carried out on how semantic transfer in natural language applies to programming language transfer; secondly, a Model of Programming Language Transfer (MPLT) is developed based on the first study's findings; thirdly, four quantitative studies are carried out to validate the model; fourthly, a study that collects school teachers' views and experiences on second language learning is carried out; fifthly, a study is conducted to explore transfer interventions with students; and the last study builds and investigates a pedagogy for transfer deriving from the MPLT. The findings support the thesis claim that semantic transfer based on syntax similarities plays a role in relative novices' conceptual transfer between programming languages. The transfer can be positive when the first programming language (PL1) and the second programming language (PL2) share similar syntax and semantics, negative when PL1 and PL2 share similar syntax but have different semantics, and there is little or no transfer when PL1 and PL2 have different syntax but share similar semantics. The results also reveal that transfer teaching interventions based on the MPLT could improve conceptual transfer and understanding in students learning a second PL. The contribution of this thesis is two-fold: First, a validated model of programming language transfer that has three categories that reflect the types of potential transfer students encounter when learning a second programming language. The model provides a unified way to measure transfer in second language learning. Second, a validated unified pedagogical guideline for promoting transfer in programming languages derived from the MPLT. Researchers, educators and curriculum designers can use these instruments to advance research, teach, and design teaching materials. First, the researchers can use the instruments to further programming language transfer research by adopting them in other programming language contexts. Second, educators can use the instruments as a guideline for improving second and subsequent programming language teaching. Lastly, Computer Science (CS) curricular designers can draw on these instruments as guidance to design teaching material that promotes transfer as students transition to new programming languages. They can also use them for teacher professional development.},

This method allows us to uncover not just the problems on which students are struggling but also the variety of difficulties different students face. Our approach is to apply methods from the Dimension Extraction Coevolutionary Algorithm to analyze problem-solving logs of students generated when they use an online software tutoring suite for introductory computer programming called problets. The results of our analysis not only have implications for how to scale up and improve adaptive tutoring software but also have the promise of contributing to the identification of common misconceptions held by students and thus, eventually, to the construction of a concept inventory for introductory programming.},

  abstract = {Programming misconceptions have been a known issue for programming novices since the beginning of programming education. During the learning process, students develop mental models about programming concepts they learn. Programming misconceptions occur when students develop incorrect mental models. Several factors can contribute to developing or preventing misconceptions, such as the age of students, choice of the programming language, and programming context. Mentioned factors are more critical for younger students. Since block-based programming languages (BPL) eliminate syntax problems and lower abstraction, they could be appropriate for elementary school introductory programming. However, when BPL is used as a first programming language, students have difficulties transferring learned programming concepts to a text-based programming language (TBPL). Nevertheless, the final goal is to introduce students to the ``real'' TBPL. In this paper, we aimed to discover can we use BPL for mediated transfer to minimise known misconceptions in a TBPL. We conducted the study to analyse the impact of using a BPL MakeCode for micro:bit for mediated transfer of basic programming concepts to the TBPL Python. The study was conducted in the school setting among 49 sixth-graders in elementary school during Informatics lectures, following the national curriculum. Therefore, students were introduced to programming using TBPL Python and afterwards, they switched to BPL MakeCode as mediated transfer tool to TBPL Python. In this paper, we deal with the impact of the mediated transfer on misconceptions in TBPL. The results indicate that the use of BPL significantly decreased the frequency of misconceptions in TBPL Python.},
