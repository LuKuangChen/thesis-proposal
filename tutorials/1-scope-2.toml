It is an error to define a variable twice within a single block.

Programs are evaluated in a specific order:

1. Every `defvar` evaluates the expression immediately and binds the variable to the value, even if the variable is not used later in the program.
2. Every function call evaluates the actual parameters immediately and binds the values to formal parameters, even when the formal parameter is not used in the function.
3. A sequence of `defvar` and `deffun` binds the variables to the values in top-to-bottom, left-to-right order.
4. It is an error to evaluate a variable reference before binding it to a value.
