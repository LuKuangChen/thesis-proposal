# PhD Thesis Proposal

## Requirements:

- https://cs.brown.edu/degrees/doctoral/proposal/

## Timeline

- 2023-12-21 is the last date of final exam period, which I assume is
  the last day of the semester as well.
- I need to prepare a proposal document by 2023-11-23 (Thursday), but
  earlier would be better because professors might be busy during the
  final exam period.
- But note that proposal can happen during winter breaks (as long as
  it is before spring.) So I might be able to do it slightly later.

## Page-limits

between ten and thirty pages
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LPU3hLNt7KXeltxJGy2bpVJl7Q5nTd_-EuPoKdPvbfE/edit

- relevant past work
- research objectives
- expected contributions
- results already achieved
- and a timeline for remaining work

## TODOs:

Prepare the following things 4-week in advance.

- [ ] Confirm that one member of the faculty who is not on your committee will be present for your talk
- [ ] abstrac, ttitle, a URL of your proposal
- [ ] the proposed date and time and the preferred room, and a zoom link
